# Eric: One way to make your code more DRY: create a method called display_text

# More generally, this would also be a way to separate your display logic from
# the rest of the program. If you wanted an SMS-interface, you wouldn't want all

# Eric: I think that this code would be improved by creating a Poem class that
# holds data/logic for individual poems, and renaming this class to
# PoemGenerator. The @saved_seed instance variable is a bit weird in this class,
# and it would be nice to store already generated poems with their seed words.
# It would also separate the "model" logic from the "controller" logic.
# Rails will force you to separate your logic in this way.

# Another thing about class/method design that I didn't talk about:
# Generally you want your methods to either return data or manipulate data, not
# both. As another rule of thumb, methods should be doing only one thing and
# thus be fairly short. Your #build_poem method is very long and could definitely
# be broken up more.

# If I were writing this program, I would probably make the WordLists have an
# instance variable array that tracks the list of words, and use WordList
# objects instead of arrays to track them. This would let you do things like
# create a WordList instance method #pick_one, so you wouldn't have to do
# arr.shuffle ... arr[0] all the time in your program.
